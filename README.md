Procedure:
Topology Design:

Network Topology:
LAN Configuration: Design a network topology featuring at least 10 computers connected through one or more switches. Ensure that the LAN configuration allows for efficient communication among all computers within this network.
WAN Configuration: Integrate the LAN network with a larger network or another LAN using routers. This WAN configuration should facilitate the interconnection of the LAN with external networks, ensuring broader connectivity.
Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer:

Add Devices:
Computers: Place and connect between 10 and 15 computers within the network. Arrange these computers in such a way that they are all connected through switches.
Switches: Add a minimum of 2 switches to handle the LAN setup. Ensure that these switches are connected appropriately to manage traffic efficiently within the LAN.
Routers: Include at least 2 routers to establish the WAN connection. Connect these routers to each other and to the switches to enable communication between the LAN and external networks.

Configure IP Addresses:
Computers: Assign unique IP addresses to all computers within the LAN, ensuring that they are within the same subnet for internal communication.
Routers: Configure the router interfaces with appropriate IP addresses to facilitate communication between the LAN and WAN. Ensure that the IP addressing scheme allows for effective routing.
Routing Configuration: Set up routing protocols (such as RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP) or configure static routes as necessary to ensure proper routing of traffic between the LAN and WAN.
Configuration Steps:

LAN Configuration:
Connect Computers to Switches: Ensure that all computers are physically connected to the switches using appropriate network cables.
Assign IP Addresses: Configure each computer with a static IP address or set up a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses.
Connect Switches: If multiple switches are used, connect them together to create a network infrastructure that supports the communication needs of all connected devices.

WAN Configuration:
Connect Routers: Connect the routers to each other using serial or Ethernet interfaces as required. Ensure that the physical connections are correctly established.
Configure Router Interfaces: Assign IP addresses to the router interfaces according to the network design. Configure each router to communicate effectively with the other routers and devices.
Implement Routing: Set up routing protocols or static routes on the routers to enable communication between the LAN and external networks. Verify that routing tables are correctly populated and that routes are properly advertised.
Simulation:

Send a Message:
Simulation Mode: Enter Cisco Packet Tracerâ€™s simulation mode to test network functionality.
Configure Message Transmission: Configure a message to be sent from a computer in one network to a computer located in another network. This can be done using a variety of applications or protocols within Packet Tracer.
Capture and Verify: Observe the simulation to capture the message transmission. Verify that the message is successfully sent and received, and ensure that all intermediate devices (such as routers and switches) are functioning as expected to facilitate the communication
